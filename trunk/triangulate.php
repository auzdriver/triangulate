	// The code, sloppy as it may be, is mine.

	// Algorithm
	// We determine the region the target lies in by creating the smallest-
	// possible n-sphere gauranteed to contain all of the points contained
	// in the overlapping region between two other n-spheres.  While this
	// necessarily returns an n-volume larger than really necessary, we're
	// gauranteed that our target is within the region, and our calculation
	// is simplified.

	// On each iteration of the algorithm, we intersect the newest data
	// point with the previous estimated region, and the smallest n-sphere
	// containing that intersection becomes our new estimated region.

	// One advantage to this method lies in that we need not keep track of
	// all of the data points we've been given.  Instead, we can simply
	// return the n-sphere approximation of the intersection between the
	// new data point and the previously calculated n-sphere. (Or the first
	// data point, if this is the first time we've calculated an n-sphere.)

	// This function was written in such a way that it should scale to as
	// many dimensions as can be reliably iterated through using a
	// floating-point iterator. (This first version is sloppy...I don't
	// know that PHP assumes integer data types if no decimal value is
	// present.)
	
	// I use PHP's arbitraty precision math support extensively, as it's the
	// only way to get around inaccuracies in IEEE floating point.  However,
	// I noticed that there might be a bug in it.
